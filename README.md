that one episode from season 6 episode 3 which is just random. happy bday abby

Basically like its giving you random scenerios and you have to make a decision and then it gives you another random thing related to what you said 

ex: 

"You are staring at a forest" 
go north 
"You go north. You stumble upon a bear carcus" 
kick it
"you kick it. It was actually alive you are now dead"

this projects includes an actions and a directions list. the directions list encompasses examples of directions a user could input. 
it scans over the user input, and if the direction matches, it adds that to reconfirm the users choice in the outcome. the actions one is the same but verbs and actions of possible user input ie. if the user enters "run forward 40 feet" the program will scan that and detect the 
word 'run' which exists in the action txt doc. it will also detect forward in the directions txt doc. it will tailor the first part 
of the output to confirm the users input. "You run forward"
