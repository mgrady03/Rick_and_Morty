that one episode from season 6 episode 3 which is just random. happy bday abby

Basically like its giving you random scenerios and you have to make a decision and then it gives you another random thing related to what you said 

ex: 

"You are staring at a forest" 
go north 
"You stumble upon a bear carcus" 
kick it
"It was actually alive you are now dead"
